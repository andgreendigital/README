# Adam Green README

Welcome to everything that you need to know about me!

This document will give you an insight into how I work best and will hopefully explain why.
After reading this document if you have an questions about how I work which I didn't answer feel free to open a issue on this repository or Slack me!

## Personal Info

I am an Associate AND Friendly Host in club Turing who joined AND in September 2018.
I am just starting my career having graduated from University of Southampton with BSc Computer Science in the summer of 2018.

I grew up in [Wokingham](https://goo.gl/maps/tpsfSotHTow) and this summer moved to [Finsbury Park](https://goo.gl/maps/vbDB2tQAhtz) with my new wife Emma.
I love to spend my weekends having friends and family to visit or having people over for dinner, hence my AND title.
And on the few occasions I get the chance I do some gaming, most commonly Total War or Cities: Skylines.

## How do I work?

- I best understand concepts by asking questions before jumping into to something. So please let me know if I ever go overboard on questions.
- I don't mind task switching and will happily do a few things at once switching between in an asynchronous manner.
However if there are too many things going on at once then this can stress me out.
- I often use headphones while working but please feel free to disturb me and talk to me.
I will put up a little sign if I really don't want to be disturbed but it is rare.
- Spelling and handwriting are not my strong points, so please bear with me!
Don't be afraid to ask me to clarify if you can't read my handwriting.
- Working hours: I try to be in the office by 9am prompt and usually leave between 5/5:30pm.
- Contact: If you need to get in touch ping me a message on Slack.

## Feedback

Please always give me any feedback that you have for me.
As I have only just started my career I am eager to improve both my work and the way that I go about it.

I'm happy to have feedback in any form although it helps to have a written copy so I can refer back to it.
I appreciate when feedback isn't anonymous although I understand this isn't always possible.
I do promise to not hold any feedback against people!

## HBDI

- Took the test on joining in September 2018.
- I am dominate in Blue and Green, the most common profile (18.92% of database).
- I like to solve problems and think though things logically.
- Organisation is important to me and I appreciate sticking to plans.
- I am quite intuitive but can struggle to imagine the big picture or be creative.
- I have strong verbal communication but sometimes aren't as sensitive as I should be.
- Under pressure I move from Yellow to Red as I focus on the detail and talk though the problems.

## Learning

Having just graduated and joined AND I am really eager to learn!
My current targets are to make real contributions as a developer, to be able to solve problems for clients and to develop code independently.

I enjoy finding out how languages work so I can work out which approach might be the best to take.
